In this project, I applied different machine learning algorithms with a purpose to predict the distance matrix for
the test data, which consists protein amino acid sequence. The model was trained on the dataset with 4,454 amino acid sequences. K Nearest Neighbors was used as the baseline standard. In addition, I also tried Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) models and automated machine learning methods.
